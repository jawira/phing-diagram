  <!-- PHIVE CONFIGURATION -->
  <!--
          By default, PHIVE stores all PHARs and some additional files containing meta data in ~/.PHIVE.
          You can change the working directory, but it is recommended to stick with it.

          <config home="~/.PHIVE" />
      -->
  <!-- DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT -->
  <!--
          If the dependency you need is listed on https://phar.io, you can simply add the alias to your config.
          Although not recommended, you can leave out the version attribute, so the newest available version will
          be installed.

          <phar name="phpunit" version="4.6.*" />
      -->
  <!--
          If the dependency you need is not listed on https://phar.io or you do not want to rely on a central database,
          you can also add an URL pointing to any PHAR to your config.

          <phar url="https://some.tld/tool.phar" />
      -->
